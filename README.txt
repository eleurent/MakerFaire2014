This Simulink project contains the files for the Mathworks Mars Rover robot competition. The primary model of interest is the simulation model, but also included is a model for execution on an Arduino DUE. The Arduino model uses a number of S-functions for use of the peripherals, including the I2C interface for communication with a Raspberry Pi. More detail on each of these models and the robot itself is included in the project documentation.
