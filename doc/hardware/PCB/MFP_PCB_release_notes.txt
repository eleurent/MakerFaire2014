v1 issues:

- increase PTH08080 holes size
- Add power and ground holes for soldering in wires (like for going to motor shield power input)
- Reverse power and ground on servo connectors
- Increase size of power and gnd input holes to accomodate large power wires, put lots of space in between pads
